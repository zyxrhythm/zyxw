- ABOUT THIS SITE -
-------------------------------
$SITEBANNER is a website you can utilize for the following: 

<strong>1.)</strong> Do a 'whois lookup' for a domain name or I.P. Address. 
-For domain names, the whois result (Registry tab result) is directly from the whois server/s set on the whois/jwhois conf file of the server in which the the site is deployed; and the Registrar Result is from the whois server obtained from the Registry Result.  
-And for IP addresses, the scripts will query the whois server/s of A.R.I.N..

<strong>2.)</strong> Do a 'dig' of D.N.S. records (A,MX,SOA,NS,TXT,SPF,CAA,AAAA) of domain names, sub domains and hostnames directly from one of Google's Public DNS server (8.8.8.8), or from a particular name server specified by the user. And Reverse an I.P. address to its domain/host name (PTR).

<strong>3.)</strong> Check info about the S.S.L. certificate issued for a domain /sub domain.

<strong>4.)</strong> Sometimes knowing the following information:

- 'whois is the registrar' 
- 'is a domain from a reseller' 
- 'what are the relevant dates under the domain name (expiration dates from the registry and the registrar and creation date)'
- 'what are the authoritative name servers under the domain'
- 'are the authoritative name server under thd domain up'
- 'what aMX and A records can be DIG`ged from authoritative name servers of a domain'
- 'is the regsitrant info available for the public'
- 'whois responsible for the the IP addresses from obtained from dig`ging around'

will allow one to troubleshoot most of the common issues about domain names (usual issues about the domain itself, the website and the email service under it). A probing script has been made for this website in which will gather the above information.
