Enter a valid/registered naked domain name (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name' target='_blank'>FQDN</a>).


The '<a href='/cgi-bin/dip.zyx'>dip.zyx</a>' script on a nutshell:  

The script utilizes the <a class='tooltip' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS#Software' target='_blank' >whois command<span class='tooltiptext'>On Unix-like operating systems, the whois command is a client for the WHOIS directory service.</span></a> to perform a whois query at the known <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>Registry<span class='tooltiptext'>Domain name registry</span></a> whois server for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain' target='_blank' class='tooltip' >TLD<span class='tooltiptext' >Top Level Domain</span></a>. If a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>Registrar<span class='tooltiptext'>Domain name registrar</span></a> whois server is found on the result of the whois query, the script will utilize the whois command again and does the same whois query on the whois server of the Registrar. 

The result of the raw whois query done on both the whois server of the Registry and the Registrar are stored.  Information about the registrar, reseller, status, creation date, expiration dates, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Authoritative_name_server' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>authoritative name servers<span class='tooltiptext'>A name server, but authoritative!</span></a>, registrant, tech contact, and admin contact of the domain name are extracted from the raw whois query result and are also stored.

Each domain status is then paired with its matching table from this article from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>ICANN<span class='tooltiptext'>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</span></a>, the table can be viewed by later by clicking the '<span style='color:tomato;'>+</span>' button before each domain status.

Days passed or days left on the creation and expiration dates are calculated by subtracting the seconds counted since Unix time until the stored relevant date from the seconds counted since Unix time until the current server time. These calculated days can be viewed later on  by clicking the '<span style='color:tomato;'>+</span>' button inline with '<span style='color:#145a32;'>Registrar Expiry Date</span>'. 

The authoritative name servers will then be validated by the script, checking if each resolves to an IP address, or in some case IP addresses, and checking if they respond to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System' target='_blank' class='tooltip' >DNS<span class='tooltiptext'>Domain Name System.</span></a> record queries. After the authoritative name servers are validated, the script utilizes the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>DIG command<span class='tooltiptext'>dig (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than dig.</span></a> to fetch the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#Resource_records' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>A record<span class='tooltiptext'>Address record.</span></a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record' class='tooltip' target='_blank'>MX record<span class='tooltiptext' >Mail eXchanger record.</span></a> from one of the validated authoritative name servers. To check the the IP address associated with each authoritative name server under the domain, or check the result of the validation process done by the script, you can click the '<span style='color:tomato;'>+</span>' inline with the last authoritative name server listed under '<strong>Name Servers:</strong>'.

The whois command is then again utilized do another  whois query, but this time to the appropriate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry'  target='_blank' class='tooltip'>RIR<span class='tooltiptext'>Regional Internet Registry.</span></a> whois server for each A record (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address' taget='_blank' class='tooltip'>IP address<span class='tooltiptext'>Internet Protocol address.</span></a>) found on the authoritative name server for the naked domain. The organization responsible for each IP address (A record) will be extracted from the result of the whois query and stored. The full whois result obtained by the script for the IP address can be viewed by clicking the '<span style='color:tomato'>&#9654;</span>' inline with each IP addresss.
    
Validation of the MX records or MX records is done by checking if each hostname on the MX record/records resolves to an IP address or in some cases IP addresses.  If a hostname resolves to an IP address or multiple IP addresses,  the script utilizes the whois command and does a  whois query to the appropriate RIR whois server for the IP address or each of the IP addresses. Again the organization responsible for each IP address will be extracted from the result of the whois query and stored. The full whois result obtained by the script for the IP address can be viewed by clicking the '<span style='color:tomato'>&#9654;</span>' inline with each IP addresss.

In the end, a concise report about the domain, and the web service and email service under it will be displayed.

-------------------
On the report page:
----------------
Clicking '<strong>Domain Status:</strong>' will go to a page in which all copied EPP status tables from ICANN are listed.
Clicking '<span style='color:tomato'>&#9960;</span>' before '<strong>Name Servers:</strong>' will go to a page from securitytrails.com that gives their history of NS records for the domain.
Clicking '<span style='color:tomato'>&#9960;</span>' before '<strong>A Record:</strong>' will go to a page from securitytrails.com that gives their history of A records for the domain.
Clicking '<span style='color:tomato'>&#9960;</span>' before '<strong>MX Record:</strong>' will go to a page from securitytrails.com that gives their history of MX records for the domain.

All stored information will be kept by the script until the execution of the script is completed or halted.

If a Registrar whois server is found on the result of the whois query done on the  Registry's whois server, the script will utilize the whois command again and will do the same query on the whois server of the Registrar. 

And for IP addresses, the script will utilize the whois command to perform a whois query to the appropriate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry'  target='_blank' class='tooltip'>RIR<span class='tooltiptext'>Regional Internet Registry.</span></a> whois server.

If the input is a domain name, the script will present two tabs. The Registry tab contains the raw whois query result from the whois server of the Registry, this tab also contains the Registry whois server queried by the script.  If a registrar whois server is found, The Registrar tab shall contain the raw whois query result from the whois server of the Registrar, this tab also contains the Registrar whois server queried by the script.  If the input is an IP address the raw whois query result from the appropriate RIR will be displayed, the page will also contain the whois server queried by the script. 

It is also possible to specify a whois server and port for the query, by clicking the '<span style='color:tomato;'>+</span>' before the Who is button.
