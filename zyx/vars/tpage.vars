Enter a valid/registered naked domain name (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name' target='_blank'>FQDN</a>).


The <a href='/cgi-bin/dip.zyx'>'dip.zyx'</a> script on a nutshell:  

The script utilizes the <a class='tooltip' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS#Software' target='_blank' >whois command<span class='tooltiptext'>On Unix-like operating systems, the whois command is a client for the WHOIS directory service.</span></a> to perform a whois query at the known Registry whois server for the TLD. If a Registrar whois server is found on the result of the whois query done on the  Registry's whois server,  the script will utilize the whois command again and will do the same query on the whois server of the Registrar. 

The result of the raw whois query done on both the whois server of the Registry and the Registrar are stored.  Information about the registrar, reseller, status, creation date, expiration dates, authoritative name servers, registrant, tech contact, and admin contact of the domain name are extracted from the raw whois query result and are also stored. All stored information will be kept by the script until the execution of the script is completed or halted.

Days passed or days left on the creation and expiration dates are calculated by subtracting the seconds counted since Unix time until the stored relevant date from the seconds counted since Unix time until the current server time.

The authoritative name servers will be validated, by checking if each resolves to an IP address, or in some case IP addresses, then checks if they respond to DNS record queries. After the authoritative name servers are validated, the script utilizes the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>DIG command<span class='tooltiptext'>dig (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than dig.</span></a> to fetch the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#Resource_records' target='_blank' class='tooltip'>A record<span class='tooltiptext'>Address record</span></a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record' class='tooltip' target='_blank'>MX record<span class='tooltiptext' >A mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.</span></a> from one of the validated authoritative name servers. 

The whois command is then again utilized do another  whois query, but this time to the appropriate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry'  target='_blank' class='tooltip'>RIR<span class='tooltiptext'>A regional Internet registry is an organization that manages the allocation and registration of Internet number resources within a particular region of the world. Internet number resources include IP addresses and autonomous system numbers.</span></a> whois server for each A record (IP address) found on the authoritative name server for the naked domain. The organization responsible for each IP address (A record) will be extracted from the result of the whois query result and stored.  
    
Validation of the MX records or MX records is done by checking if each hostname on the MX record/records resolves to an IP address or in some cases IP addresses.  If a hostname resolves to an IP address or multiple IP addresses,  the script utilizes the whois command and does a  whois query to the appropriate RIR whois server for the IP address or each of the IP addresses. Again the organization responsible for each IP address will be extracted from the result of the whois query result and stored.  

In the end,  a concise report about the domain and the web service and email service under it will be displayed.

<strong>Current Input</strong>: none

Enter a valid domain name (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name' target='_blank'>FQDN</a>) / <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4' taget='_blank'>IPv4 Address</a>.


The '<a href='/cgi-bin/whois.zyx'>whois.zyx</a>' script on a nutshell:  

The <a class='tooltip' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS#Software' target='_blank' >whois command<span class='tooltiptext'>On Unix-like operating systems, the whois command is a client for the WHOIS directory service.</span></a> is utilized by the script to perform a whois query at the known Registry whois server for the  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain' target='_blank' class='tooltip' >TLD<span class='tooltiptext' >Top Level Domain</span></a>. If a Registrar whois server is found on the result of the whois query done on the  Registry's whois server,  the script will utilize the whois command again and will do the same query on the whois server of the Registrar. 

And for IP addresses, the script will utilize the whois command to perform a whois query to the appropriate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry'  target='_blank' class='tooltip'>RIR<span class='tooltiptext'>Regional Internet Registry.</span></a> whois server.

If the input is a domain name, the script will present two tabs. The Registry tab contains the raw whois query result from the whois server of the Registry, this tab also contains the Registry whois server queried by the script.  If a registrar whois server is found, The Registrar tab shall contain the raw whois query result from the whois server of the Registrar, this tab also contains the Registrar whois server queried by the script.  If the input is an IP address the raw whois query result from the appropriate RIR will be displayed, the page will also contain the whois server queried by the script. 

Note: You can also specify a whois server and port to query by clicking the '+'.
