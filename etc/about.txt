>> The developer have been working with domains names for quite some time, and based on what he had experience there are only a few vital things about the raw whois result and the raw result from dig that allow one to troubleshoot most of the common issues about domain names (usually about the website and the email service). And so he made it easier to check on this vital deatails by creating a script that will filter out and show only the vital stuffs from the raw result.
